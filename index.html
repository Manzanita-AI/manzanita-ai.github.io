        <h2>Manzanita Artificial Intelligence Company</h2>
        <p>Humans have long dreamed of artificially intelligent agents.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest known Hellenistic epics, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm" target="_blank"><i>The Argonautica</i></a>, references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos" target="_blank">Talos</a>, a bronze automaton who guarded Crete by launching boulders at invading ships. Thousands of years later, perhaps inspired by <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/engines/" target="_blank">Babbage's Analytical Engine</a>, Oscar Wilde <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/" target="_blank">imagined a day</a> where machines performed all the “ugly, horrible, uninteresting work”, freeing humans for “culture and contemplation”. This year, fueled by similar visions, the Auto-GPT autonomous agent project became one of the fastest growing <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT" target="_blank">GitHub repositories</a> in history, skyrocketing to <a href="https://star-history.com/#Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT&Date" target="_blank">nearly 150k stars</a> in three months.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqVLjtvWgq8" target="_blank">hype around AI agents</a> is frothier than ever, but when unleashed on real-world tasks agents still <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1655621063257063425?s=20" target="_blank">fall disappointingly short</a> of their potential. We learned this firsthand prototyping our first agent, Otter, a browser-based agent powered by <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>. Designed to perform complex tasks with a high-level natural language prompt (”order me a coffee”), Otter showed early promise by navigating unprompted to <a href="https://starbucks.com" target="_blank">starbucks.com</a> and adding a <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages" target="_blank">Frappuccino®</a> to the shopping cart, only to quickly sputter – last we checked, Otter was stuck in an infinite loop in a shopping cart somewhere on the internet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/13ii7se/customer_ordered_36_pumps_of_syrups_took_this_pic/" target="_blank">adding flavor pumps</a> ad infinitum.</p>
        <p>It’s not  unreasonable to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html" target="_blank">dismiss AI agents as toys</a>. You wouldn’t be the first dismiss nascent technology as such – <a href="https://twitter.com/NedPotter_" target="_blank">Ned Potter</a>, writing for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ctECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22What+can+you+do+with+it+once+you+have+got+it?+Well,+uh,+you+can+do+your+taxes+on+it.+But+it%E2%80%99s+easier+to+hire+an+accountant.+You+could+balance+your+checkbook+with+it.+But+that%E2%80%99s+a+little+like+killing+a+fly+with+a+cannon.+You+could+play+games+with+it.+But+there+are+video+Pong+sets+now+that+sell+for+$25%22&source=bl&ots=leBtjcl-kG&sig=ACfU3U0CgqXdRW6jhC__vJVD-fUAzJ_c-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9rKmOtOn_AhU0mGoFHSI1Aj8Q6AF6BAgWEAM#v=onepage&q=%22What%20can%20you%20do%20with%20it%20once%20you%20have%20got%20it%3F%20Well%2C%20uh%2C%20you%20can%20do%20your%20taxes%20on%20it.%20But%20it%E2%80%99s%20easier%20to%20hire%20an%20accountant.%20You%20could%20balance%20your%20checkbook%20with%20it.%20But%20that%E2%80%99s%20a%20little%20like%20killing%20a%20fly%20with%20a%20cannon.%20You%20could%20play%20games%20with%20it.%20But%20there%20are%20video%20Pong%20sets%20now%20that%20sell%20for%20%2425%22&f=false" target="_blank">New York Magazine in 1979</a> (merely three years after the release of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I" target="_blank">Apple I</a>), similarly dismissed the personal computer:</p>
        <blockquote>What can you do with it once you have got it? Well, uh, you can do your taxes on it. But it’s easier to hire an accountant. You could balance your checkbook with it. But that’s a little like killing a fly with a cannon. You could play games with it. But there are video Pong sets now that sell for $25.</blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes, yesterday’s toys become tomorrow’s <a href="https://g.co/finance/AAPL:NASDAQ" target="_blank">$3T public companies</a>.</p>
        <p>We’re betting the farm on the idea that the trajectory of AI agents <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/" target="_blank">will rhyme</a> with that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers" target="_blank">microcomputer</a>. We’re committed to tackling the hard technical challenges required to make agents work in the real world, starting by building the world’s first AI agent performance suite.</p>
        <p>We’re focusing our efforts on three key areas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tuning</li>
            <li>Retrieval</li>
            <li>Observability</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our first product, Sapling, is in private beta. It’s an easy-to-use library that agent developers can use to distill operations performed by massive language models into tightly defined, highly performant functions driven by lightweight, specialized open-source language models.</p>
