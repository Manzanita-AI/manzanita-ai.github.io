        <h2>Manzanita Artificial Intelligence Company</h2>
        <p>We help AI engineers build performant agents.</p>
        <p>Our first product, Sapling, is an easy-to-use library that agent developers use to distill operations performed by massive LLMs into tightly defined, low-latency functions driven by specialized, lightweight language models. It's in private beta - if you're building AI agents, we'd love to chat: <a href="https://cal.com/manzanita-ai/ai-agent-performance" target="_blank">click here</a> to schedule a call.</p>
        <p>Why bet the farm on agents?</p>
        <p>It's a reasonable question: <a href="https://star-history.com/#Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT&Date" target="_blank">despite the hype</a>, agents <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1655621063257063425?s=20" target="_blank">fall disappointingly short</a> of their potential when unleashed on real-world tasks. At Manzanita, we learned this firsthand when prototyping Otter, a browser-based agent powered by <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>. Designed to perform complex tasks with a high-level natural language prompt ("order me a coffee"), Otter showed early promise by navigating unprompted to <a href="https://starbucks.com" target="_blank">Starbucks.com</a> and adding a <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages" target="_blank">Frappuccino®</a> to the shopping cart, only to quickly sputter - last we checked, Otter was stuck in an infinite loop in a shopping cart somewhere on the internet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/13ii7se/customer_ordered_36_pumps_of_syrups_took_this_pic/" target="_blank">adding flavor pumps</a> ad infinitum.</p>

        <blockquote>What can you do with it once you have got it? Well, uh, you can do your taxes on it. But it's easier to hire an accountant. You could balance your checkbook with it. But that's a little like killing a fly with a cannon. You could play games with it. But there are video Pong sets now that sell for $25.</blockquote>
        <p>Yesterday's toys are today's <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ" target="_blank">$3T public companies</a>, and we think <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/" target="_blank">the history of AI agents will rhyme</a>. So we're setting out to tackle the hard technical problems required to make agents work in the real world, focusing our initial efforts on three key areas: (1) tuning, (2) retrieval, and (3) observability.</p>
        <p>Manzanita comes from a long lineage of humans who've dreamed of artificially intelligent agents, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes" target="_blank">Apollonius of Rhodes</a>, who, in one of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm" target="_blank">the earliest known Greek epics</a>, describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos" target="_blank">Talos</a>, a bronze automaton who guarded Crete by launching boulders at invading ships. Thousands of years later, perhaps inspired by <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/engines/" target="_blank">Babbage's Analytical Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/" target="_blank">Oscar Wilde</a> imagined a day where machines would perform all the “horrible, uninteresting work”, freeing humans for “culture and contemplation”.</p>
        <p>Let's build this future together.</p>
